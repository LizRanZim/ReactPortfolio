# ReactPortfolio

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is a portfolio of my work during a Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp.

## Notes: 
I am currently employed and not looking for a job so I have uploaded a sample resume for the purposes of the project. Also I do not wish to link to my current LinkedIn profile, so I added the LinkedIn profile of a person I admire to the footer.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build.
